### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Tiago, passionate by software development, design and architecture.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Magento 2 development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a better version of myself each day
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to Magento development
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love video-games (God of War is the best game ever!) but it lacks me time to play sometimes...
