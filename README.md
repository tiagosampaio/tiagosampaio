### Hi there 👋,

I’m Tiago — a passionate software developer, designer, and software architect.

- 🔭 Currently focused on Magento 2 development
- 🌱 Always learning and working to become a better version of myself every day
- 💬 Feel free to ask me anything about Magento development — I love helping the community!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a huge video game fan (God of War is my all-time favorite!) — though finding time to play is another battle… 🎮
- 🏗️ Owner and maintainer of MagedIn Technology’s repositories here on GitHub
